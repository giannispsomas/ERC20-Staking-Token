    Contract Setup
    Define the contract name, symbol, decimals, and total supply.
    Initialize mappings for balances, allowances, staking balances, staking status, and stake times.
    Define events for transfer, approval, staking, unstaking, burning, and minting.
    Constructor
    Accept an initial supply as a parameter.
    Assign the initial supply to the contract deployer's balance and set the total supply.
    Token Management Functions
    balanceOf: Return the balance of a given address.
    transfer: Move tokens from the sender to a recipient.
    transferFrom: Move tokens from one address to another, given approval.
    approve: Approve another address to spend tokens on behalf of the sender.
    allowance: Return the remaining number of tokens that a spender is allowed to spend on behalf of the owner.
    Staking Functions
    stakeTokens: Allow a user to stake a specified amount of tokens.
    unstakeTokens: Allow a user to unstake their tokens, applying a burn or mint mechanism based on the staking duration.
    Burn and Mint Functions
    burn: Destroy a specified amount of tokens from a user's balance.
    mint: Create a specified amount of new tokens and add them to a user's balance.
    Staking Logic
    When a user stakes tokens, update their staking balance, set their staking status to true, and record the stake time.
    When a user unstakes tokens, check the time elapsed since staking.
    If less than or equal to 50 days, burn 15% of the staked tokens.
    If more than 50 days, mint 15% of the staked tokens.
    Update the user's balance with the remaining staked tokens and reset their staking status.
